The code section includes the following elements:

Blast - with reference to the identification of pseudogene-parental gene associations

Quality Control - with reference to pre-profling computational steps of mapping, expression filters, sample analyses

Methods -  with reference to the 5 profiling methods we have used first individually and then in the ensemble approach

Models - with reference to the two post-profiling models used for further inference on top of the 5 methods, plus the statistics used for the selection of the significant values (boxplots and IQR)

Visualizations - with reference to the graphics that we have originally proposed in various sections of the paper
